00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.230
Let me welcome all of you on
behalf of MIT, on behalf of

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.140
the Office of Educational
Innovation and Technology, and

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.550
on behalf of our partners here,
Apple, Scott's, I don't

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.070
know, it's not always good to
extend the family metaphor

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.110
because of all the intended
dysfunctionality, but, you

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.930
know, it's like a member of an
extended family over here.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.870
But, really, we welcome you
to MIT and to this event.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.420
There is a lot of planning,
I know.

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.660
Not just what Scott was talking
about, I watched

11
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.030
Andrew, who works in our office,
along with Jeff and

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.900
Judy go at it you know,
for quite some time.

13
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.090
So it's a treat to have you
over here and to have this

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.890
event over here.

15
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.410
I'm not going to be talking
about OEIT today, although the

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.630
Office of Educational Innovation
and Technology,

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.330
although, you know, I'm hoping
to touch on some examples, as

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.190
they are relevant to
my conversation.

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.425
I should also apologize to you
in advance, I'm not doing to

20
00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:09.540
be singing for you today.

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.350
My voice is a little bit off,
but I do hope to talk about

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.560
some things open, and really
about this gathering storm,

23
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.460
you know, which I call the open
education movement, and

24
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.720
the potentially implications
it has for

25
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.750
transforming education.

26
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.970
And you know, it was really
about, I don't know if it was

27
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.930
at 2:00 in the morning today or
7:00 in the morning today.

28
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.690
You know I got onto MIT's web
page, and this was the page,

29
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.380
and I said wow!

30
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.380
You know, somebody paid somebody
to do this, because

31
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.570
it really epitomizes at least
certainly the institutional

32
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.970
commitment part of openness that
we want to talk about.

33
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.360
Last week at the faculty
meeting, not in this room,

34
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.610
some faculty meetings are held
in this room, but in another

35
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.640
renovated space in the main
drag, MIT faculty wanted to

36
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.740
provide, you know, to allow the
institute to provide open

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.850
access to all scholarly
articles, which sort of shows

38
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.710
the commitment and, of course,
most of you have heard about

39
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.730
OpenCourseWare, which was the
educational version of this.

40
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.360
So there's, you know, so there's
some institutional

41
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.300
teeth to this movement,
certainly as far as we are

42
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.050
concerned here at MIT.

43
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:45.110
So, having -- let me pop it up
there and -- so, I chose an

44
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.340
old expression to describe a new
phenomenon, you know the

45
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.200
new deal, only to signify the
tremendous opportunity that I

46
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.640
see, this open education
movement has, and, you know,

47
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.020
it's characterized by open
content, open knowledge, open

48
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.140
technology and all these
dimensions sort of describe

49
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.580
the envelope of the open
education movement.

50
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.650
And the top part, you know, in
this world of borrowing and

51
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.760
collaboration euphemistically
called match ups, actually

52
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.760
borrowed the top part of that,
advancing the educational life

53
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.400
of information resources of
title from a guru of mine,

54
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.750
John Seely Brown, who many of
you know had this social life

55
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.680
of information.

56
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.720
The thesis there being that
the community really gives

57
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360
meaning to information.

58
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.910
And here, my pitch is that a lot
of what openness is about

59
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.000
is breathing educational life
into information resources

60
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.200
which are becoming available and
plenty, through, you know,

61
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.940
through the kinds of initiatives
that I'm going to

62
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.190
talk about.

63
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.420
So the promise was best
articulated by Chuck Vest, who

64
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.550
was President here at MIT, who
is now the President of the

65
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.150
National Academy, National
Academy for Engineering, and

66
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.920
it was under his championship,
actually, that OpenCourseWare

67
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.970
at MIT was launched.

68
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.110
And Fred painted this,
you know, this

69
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.050
vision, if you will.

70
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.180
And he said we are talking about
OpenCourseWare and the

71
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.720
surrounding initiatives that
were sprouting at that time,

72
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.360
to say we are seeing the early
emergence of a Metaversity.

73
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.840
A transcendent, accessible,
empowering, dynamic community

74
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.230
constructed framework of open
materials and platforms, on

75
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.960
which much of higher education
worldwide can be constructed

76
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.260
or enhanced.

77
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.910
And it's a tremendous vision.

78
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.430
It is a vision of
the Metaversity.

79
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.100
And what I am contending today
is that much of what you have

80
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.730
seen, remarkable as it is, the
OpenCourseWare as a movement,

81
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.230
and I'll point to some of the
evidence, is the first phase

82
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.000
off that vision.

83
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.900
It is Metaversity part one, and
the kinds of things that

84
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.640
we are all engaged in really
points to a deeper vision of

85
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:15.480
this second phase, which is
more akin to what I think

86
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.090
Chuck is trying to describe
over there, the

87
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.040
Metaversity part two.

88
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.970
So, very quickly, some off the
artifacts some off the

89
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.530
evidence of this gathering storm
that I refer to are some

90
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.560
of the things that categorize
the Metaversity part one.

91
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.900
Of course, we like to start
with OpenCourseWare.

92
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.865
Around 2000, when MIT very
boldly, and some of us thought

93
00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:48.220
at that time thought rationally,
announced that it

94
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.080
would make the content of all
its courses available on the

95
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.100
web for free to the world.

96
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.350
And I remember being in the
room, as part of the Counsel

97
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.930
in Education Technology when
the sub-group came back and

98
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.850
said, you know, maybe
we should do this.

99
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.760
And there were two remarkable
things that

100
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.120
happened, that are true.

101
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.160
One was our emotional
response.

102
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.420
We said, whoa -- this is big,
you know, and, which was

103
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.880
tremendous.

104
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.960
We all knew this was something
very important.

105
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.160
The second thing was none
of us knew what

106
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.390
it meant, you know.

107
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.110
So, we said, well, but
it was powerful.

108
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.940
None of us really understood the
profound implications that

109
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.670
have subsequently emerged
from that announcement.

110
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.810
Of course, one of the side
benefits, and then since then

111
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.680
lots has happened, you know.

112
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:46.740
A couple of Octobers ago MIT,
all of MIT's 1,800 courses

113
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.180
were actually made available
through OpenCourseWare, and --

114
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.070
which is tremendous, which is
sort of -- you know, the first

115
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.215
item was Daily Word, and the
first part of the promise was

116
00:06:59.215 --> 00:06:59.940
Daily Word.

117
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.160
Now, one side benefit that I
always like to point out from

118
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.250
OpenCourseWare is that we like
to say to MIT that we figured

119
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.350
out actually how many courses
there were, indeed, at MIT.

120
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.710
So we, you know, because we said
all the courses, like in

121
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.270
the old days we used to talk
about the Athena computing

122
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.050
environment.

123
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.360
It was sort of everything, but
we didn't exactly what it was,

124
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.510
and 1,800 was a good number,
so that's where it come.

125
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.810
So that was there, but the
interesting thing about the

126
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.420
open education movement that
I'm referring to was

127
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.930
certainly, motivated, led,
catalyzed by OpenCourseWare,

128
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.890
but that's not the movement,
and it's not even, when we

129
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.690
announced OpenCourseWare, it
was interesting because the

130
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.730
kinds of letters we'd get from
all over the world, MIT used

131
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:57.510
to get, and typically in
presentations, and in fact, if

132
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.060
you go to the MIT OpenCourseWare
site, you will

133
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.900
see stats on the millions off
hits and how much access, and

134
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.000
that's all wonderful.

135
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.810
That's great data.

136
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:14.810
That's great information, but
the impact data is really

137
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.590
vignette like this, when you
talk about the fact that when

138
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.630
you put out resources like
OpenCourseWare, people can use

139
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.140
it for curriculum formulation
elsewhere.

140
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:28.130
It serves as a model and so it's
not just about consuming

141
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.010
the content that is put over
there, but being able to learn

142
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.880
from it the way it is put
together, the way it is

143
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.100
structured in order that you
can do your own thing more

144
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.440
efficiently.

145
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.950
So this is, Richard Hall, who
says it saved him an enormous

146
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.470
amount of time and stress.

147
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.070
I could use some
of that myself.

148
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.830
So, the other kind of vignette,
which I look at as

149
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.600
evidence is this one, where,
you know, you actually have

150
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.730
students elsewhere who are using
this, and who actually

151
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.310
go and look at the notes in
OpenCourseWare and then use

152
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.120
them as supplements to what
they're learning.

153
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.880
And by the way, this is a
phenomenon that I experience

154
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.060
all the time when I'm giving
talks, for instance, in India,

155
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.230
I'd be there giving a talk to
you know, some 1,700 people in

156
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.180
a class like this, and I'll as
for a show of hands, how many

157
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.560
of you have heard of OCW, you
know, the hands will go up.

158
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.130
Then I'll ask, how many
of you use OCW?

159
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:28.030
And what is remarkable is that
there are classes where all

160
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.390
the students would have their
hands up, you know.

161
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.020
And unselfconsciously, with
the instructor over there,

162
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.690
because they using get
the supplements.

163
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:43.410
Sometimes they're looking at it
as a benchmark, to ask an

164
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.330
instructor why isn't our course
looking like that, or

165
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.040
why aren't we covering those
aspects of the content?

166
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.510
So you can start to see the
kinds of implications of

167
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.720
things open.

168
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.510
It is not just about
being able to go

169
00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.690
and grab the contents.

170
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.770
It serves as a model.

171
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.010
It serves as a benchmark.

172
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.070
It serves as a mirror into your
quality, and this is,

173
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.040
these are the --

174
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.750
I'm trying to start giving you
hints of the transubmitive

175
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.310
impact of things open.

176
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.090
Again, but that's is
not the movement.

177
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.700
This was, so far I've
talked about OCW.

178
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.850
What characterized the movement
was, now actually

179
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.920
hundreds of OCWs that started.

180
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.550
There's a consortium with
160 institutions.

181
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.680
Brandon, sitting over there,
is actually involved in the

182
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.360
consortium, as I am.

183
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.120
So the number of universities
who started making there

184
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.390
materials available, and number
of initiatives that

185
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.920
started making their resources
available in one form or the

186
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.550
other, making them available
for consumption across the

187
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.830
world for free.

188
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:55.340
So that characterizes the scale
of the movement, and why

189
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.700
I use terms like a gatherings
storm, because this is big.

190
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.980
I go to the Commonwealth of
Learning meetings in London,

191
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.450
and they say, well you know,
we have to have OER as a

192
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.410
strategy for extensive access
to education in developing

193
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.360
countries, you know.

194
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.440
And why they are able to make
statements like that is

195
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.760
because they see the evidence
of the movement in pretty

196
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.610
dramatically ways.

197
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.330
So that's one part.

198
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.160
I mention the consortium.

199
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.860
Now, typically we think this is
all about higher education.

200
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.200
Not true, you know.

201
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.710
There are very significant K
through 12 initiatives, some

202
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.210
of which you see listed
before you.

203
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:38.150
One that Scott mentioned
in my introduction.

204
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.840
Curriki which I served as
adviser to, which actually

205
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.160
came out of Scott McNealy's
championship from Sun

206
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.600
Microsystems, but this is, the
Curriki initiative is to make

207
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.450
sure that you can create a
framework so that people can

208
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.590
contribute resources for K
through 12, and then make it

209
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.240
widely available in an
open-fashion and open-source

210
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.610
model, and mapping it to
regional, local and curricula,

211
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.970
not just in this country,
but elsewhere.

212
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.990
So in the K through 12 domain
also there is a palpable

213
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:16.210
movement, open movement, and
you know, with some good

214
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.530
materials, people say, well
you know, if it's open, it

215
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.610
won't be good.

216
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.560
It's all bitter medicine
thing.

217
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.720
And there are some very, very
good pieces off educational

218
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.200
courseware, you know, applets
if you will, to teach

219
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.750
different concepts.

220
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.780
And this contribution from
around the world, there are

221
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.110
initiatives that have been
launched, to filter, to make

222
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.920
sure there is good, appropriate
content.

223
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.620
MIT itself has provided a
channel to its OpenCourseWare

224
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.410
for, you know, for
higher education.

225
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.560
We call it highlights for high
school, where you provide

226
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.980
particular channels into courses
and content which

227
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.320
might be relevant for high
school consumption, for

228
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.600
advanced placement of, you know,
of advanced preparation.

229
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.240
This is a resource that I
like to point to in the

230
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.610
K through 12 domain.

231
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.370
This was an initiative that was
launch by Carl Wyman, no

232
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.890
less, who was the year before
last, Novel Laureate in

233
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.310
physics, and he had launched
this when he was at the

234
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.710
University of Colorado.

235
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.250
And, where, if you go to this
site, and now of course, Carl

236
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.940
has moved on to University of
British Columbia, and this

237
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.800
site is there.

238
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.060
It is maintained by his group.

239
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.570
It is openly, maid
openly available.

240
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.660
And if you go to the site, you
will find that there is very,

241
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.580
you know, there'll be statements
about how the

242
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.140
resources over there have
been evaluated.

243
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.570
There has been very, very good,
you know, they have

244
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.030
founded, they have been
developed on very, very good

245
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.930
educational principles.

246
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.870
There has been some amount of
vigorous evaluation done.

247
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.560
All this to tell you that there
is open stuff there,

248
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.820
good stuff that, there is
quality stuff there, capable

249
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.270
off making great transformative
contribution to

250
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.910
education as we know it.

251
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.220
And what happens is, over time,
when you start doing

252
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.000
these things, the kind of sort
of vision that Scott was

253
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.390
alluding to, you start
seeing pieces of.

254
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:32.510
But like I said, that's all
fantastic, but it's still --

255
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.110
I characterize all that
as F part one.

256
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:41.370
Part two, I think, is when, and
if you've noticed, many of

257
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.210
those are about fantastic
resources, largely about

258
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:51.810
content, and they are
stand-alone, they are

259
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.430
disparitary resources, but
transformative impact or

260
00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.100
systemic change, I think, for
education, happens when we can

261
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:06.670
move from there to another kind
of place where we can

262
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.020
actually provide quality end to
an educational experience

263
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.300
through things open.

264
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.130
So when we think about
end-to-end educational

265
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.260
experiences, we think not only
about content, but how we

266
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.570
might be able to do, provide
first-hand experiences,

267
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:25.500
laboratory experiences, as, you
know, to complement good

268
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.710
content out there.

269
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.800
How might we provide good
interactive experiences for

270
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:38.490
people learning and how we
might actually harvest

271
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.690
resources that might be
available anywhere and

272
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.810
productivity combine them to
deliver different kinds of

273
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.150
learning experiences to suit
different audiences.

274
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:54.770
And, really keep the focus on
quality, the fact that you can

275
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.800
generate new kinds
of experiences,

276
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.390
new kinds of material.

277
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.720
So what I'd like to do now is
just point to some off the

278
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.400
kinds of initiatives, and I will
apologize, many of the

279
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.660
initiatives that I'm pointing
to are MIT based, but you

280
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.080
know, I talk about what
I know better.

281
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.280
So I'll point to them,
but they're done.

282
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.720
And I'll also point out that
they might have been launched

283
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.280
at MIT, but right from the
get-go they involved other

284
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.890
institutions, other players.

285
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.960
But they speak to the kinds
of, the value proposition

286
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.680
elements that I think will take
us to to this vision of a

287
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.350
Metaversity II.

288
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:47.610
So, this is an initiative that
I like to talk about a lot.

289
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.280
On the left is Jesus del Alamo
he is a professor right here,

290
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.950
upstairs, teaches in electrical
engineering.

291
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.960
So some years ago, he started
this thing called iLab and the

292
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.760
intent of iLab is to provide
access to real laboratories

293
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.960
over the internet, not
simulations, actually labs.

294
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.220
So, initially it started off
with some, you know, network

295
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.330
signal analyzer and for digital

296
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.960
signal processing courses.

297
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.680
And then there were some other
labs that actually got

298
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.960
launched, and we had students
from Singapore, from Sweden

299
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.130
sort of places who
were actually

300
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.990
conducting labs over here.

301
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.850
And, you know, then we had some
of our Cambridge students

302
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.260
actually looking at, you know,
we had a partnership with the

303
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.800
University of Cambridge,
who was

304
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.900
looking at chemical reactors.

305
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.330
There was a civil engineering, a
shake table experiment to do

306
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:49.500
seismic measurements, and
these work controlled,

307
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.240
accessed, through browsers, and
people actually adjusted

308
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.990
the parameters, saw the results,
and not only that,

309
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.310
there were communities swarming
which would discuss

310
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.990
the results.

311
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:05.730
And in fact, we have one that is
going on right now, an NSF

312
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.740
supported project where K
through 12 students have

313
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.840
browser-based access.

314
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.370
MIT has a benign, friendly,
nuclear reactor.

315
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.350
I have to put all these
qualifiers over there, but you

316
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:23.430
know, it's provides
access to those.

317
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.940
And you can see, I mean you can
imagine the empowerment

318
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.260
when K through 12 students are
watching these neutrons go,

319
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.640
and by the way, the same
browser-based access that is

320
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.700
providing data for spectrometry
experiments to a

321
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:42.700
nuclear engineering program,
but the fact is that iLabs,

322
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:48.440
the technical architecture,
the framework iLabs, makes

323
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.380
labs available, labs accessible

324
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.860
openly over the internet.

325
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.440
So that's brings a first-time,
hands-on experience to

326
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.290
complement open resources
that might be

327
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.590
available in a course.

328
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:07.240
Now, so you can see, and I
normally talk about this more

329
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.770
than I should, but I'm really
passionate about this.

330
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.730
Because, one of the things that
you find that happens,

331
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.670
and this is a transformative
dimension of this, is that

332
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.750
iLabs is not just about making
expensive equipment, you know,

333
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.330
a radio telescope accessible
to people, you know, but it

334
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.870
really alters the economics
of lab instruction.

335
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.730
Labs are expensive,
whether they're

336
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.580
small labs or big labs.

337
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.770
You configure them.

338
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.590
They take time to
be configured.

339
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.030
They are one-time
installation.

340
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:40.850
You set it up.

341
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.560
You do it.

342
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.310
Then you've got to wait long
time before you set up again.

343
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.700
There's always latency.

344
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.500
I do not know about your
education, but you know,

345
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.160
Monday you got the lecture.

346
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.410
And a couple of weeks later
you did the lab work

347
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.210
or didn't do it.

348
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.880
Solid latency between when you
learned the concept and you

349
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.690
would actually be able
to learn from it.

350
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.920
So it was expensive, you know,
what IT affrays, it was

351
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.260
expensive in terms of
the learner's time.

352
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.260
It was expensive in terms of
the fact that there were

353
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:14.550
one-time installation, and
suddenly this iLab project

354
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.220
provides the potential to say,
you know, this 24 by 7 access

355
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.480
for this, being able to leverage
a setup much more

356
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.130
extensively, can dramatically
alter the economics of

357
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.800
laboratory instruction.

358
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.100
That is, of course, if you
believe as we do, that

359
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.620
laboratory instruction,
first-hand experiences are a

360
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.450
very important part off the
educational experience.

361
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.400
And you know, there are things
that, we had students here for

362
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.730
one time, I remember, who wanted
to do some experiments

363
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.300
with Compaq's clean labs.

364
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.240
We, Compaq didn't want our
student traipsing all over the

365
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.050
clean labs over there, but the
setup allowed us to do

366
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.950
controlled experiments
in the clean labs.

367
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.050
So you can start imagining the
implications, not only for

368
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.630
formal education, but things
like vocational education,

369
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.480
cannot connect up with equipment
that might be

370
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.680
available industry.

371
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.110
So it has the potential to

372
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.470
dramatically alter the economics.

373
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.460
Now, again, the interesting
things about iLab and open

374
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.990
iLabs is not the five or six or
seven labs that have been

375
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.920
set up at MIT and being made
accessible, but the fact that

376
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.850
there are labs elsewhere, in
fact, both at the University

377
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.720
of Queensland our colleague,
Phil Hong, who's there.

378
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.020
University of Queensland, China,
they have more labs in

379
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.530
the iLab framework than
actually MIT has.

380
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.590
And so the architecture allows
lab anywhere to be set up.

381
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.680
In fact, for us, the value
proposition is that we might

382
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.440
want our students to
access labs that

383
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.310
have been set up elsewhere.

384
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.400
So that's the value proposition,
and that's where

385
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.610
the openness dimension comes the
open architecture, allows

386
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.450
people to set up labs, big or
small, and make it accessible

387
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.630
to students all over
the world.

388
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.200
So, I'm pointing to a
couple of things.

389
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.750
This is done at our office, at
the Office of Educational

390
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.790
Innovation and Technology.

391
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.210
The day before yesterday, Chuck
Schubert, who heads this

392
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.970
group called the Star Group,
at, oh yes, he came and you

393
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.740
know, had me sign a few forms,
a whole bunch of the Star

394
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.000
tools for visualization in
biology, in genetic modeling

395
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.690
for genetic modeling for
hydrology, that had been set

396
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:33.230
up, are now an open source
and made available.

397
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.780
So these are fantastic
simulations.

398
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.650
And why I'm pointing to these
particular ones, because there

399
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:46.030
is educational, because they
are tied to some very good

400
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:51.840
deep thinking about tools that
are available openly, and you

401
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.840
know, there are great
visualization tools tools, and

402
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.540
we've all seen them.

403
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.310
They are common.

404
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.760
This is part of a program that
we have at OEIT to bridge

405
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.640
research and learning, to
bring, to provide our

406
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.550
undergraduate students,
first-year students, with

407
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.600
early exposure to research
tools, and the kinds of

408
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.690
applications that typically
are only available to

409
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.920
researchers.

410
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.570
And how can we remove the
operational fog from these, so

411
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.090
that first-year students, again
in this case even K

412
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.600
through 12 students, can
actually use these tools.

413
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.850
This visualization that is seen
which looks like Justin,

414
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.266
who also works with us,
twirling, you know, when they

415
00:23:30.266 --> 00:23:33.410
are visualizing DNA molecules,
students look at it, They make

416
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.700
conjectures about
it's properties.

417
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.870
They can reach into Cornell's
protein database, make

418
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:46.230
comparisons now, and so you
provide some very empowering

419
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.970
experiences and exposure to very
big professional tools

420
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.980
and profession thinking, and
provide them the confidence by

421
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.830
creating visualizations
like this, with

422
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.790
students can control.

423
00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:02.700
Now these kinds of simulations
of tools are available in the

424
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:07.720
open, and what lies under them
is a lot of good thinking,

425
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.050
hard problems that certainly are
a faculty of experience,

426
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.640
in bringing research concepts
into learning, because it's

427
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.300
all nice to say, you know, we
want to have lots of proximity

428
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.770
between research and teaching,
but to create tangible,

429
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.080
manageable crosswalks is not
easy, and you do it through

430
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.020
these tools, and then you make
these tools widely available

431
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.850
so that students all over
can benefit from it.

432
00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.910
So, I'm trying to give you
a sense of the kinds of

433
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:48.330
possibilities, the enablements
that lead to this vision, this

434
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.050
vision that is more advanced
than the current capabilities

435
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.790
that open resources
have created.

436
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:57.190
Now this is a project, this is
very dear to my friend, Andrew

437
00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.865
over there, and he and his team,
and Brandon, they are

438
00:25:01.865 --> 00:25:03.000
all working on this.

439
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.010
This is a project that was
started by a professor

440
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:09.090
upstairs, a Professor Jim Glass
in Computer Science, and

441
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:13.640
what it does is it uses natural
language recognition,

442
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.380
voice recognition,
summarization.

443
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.180
And the intent is to provide
very, very acute and good

444
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.660
access to digitized content.

445
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:30.380
So we have digital video of
lectures and the idea is to go

446
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.410
search these to get particular
snippets of the lectures that

447
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.280
might be relevant.

448
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.400
So, for instance, what you can't
see, probably seen in

449
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.430
the highlight, there's
a lot of angular

450
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.890
momentum showing up.

451
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.290
So what we are working on is to
make sure that you can use

452
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:52.720
this to go and find all those
lecture segments that deal

453
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.580
with angular momentum, because
if I as an instructor, want to

454
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.680
provide some deeper thinking,
a nuance learning around the

455
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.640
notion of angular momentum, I
want to be able to make sure

456
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.520
the students can get efficiently
to that section,

457
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.660
because you know, it might occur
all over the place in

458
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.820
the course of a lecture or in
the course of a 14-week

459
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.500
semester, where this topic might
be treated in different

460
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.370
ways, and you want students to
go very, very efficiently to

461
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.140
those segments and get there.

462
00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.440
So the Spoken Lecture Browser
provides very, very -- as it's

463
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:30.650
named -- browser-based access,
and, but it uses, like I said,

464
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.210
natural language recognition
to get there.

465
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.130
This is a very exciting project,
and what we are

466
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.145
trying to do is see how this
can be really leveraged not

467
00:26:38.145 --> 00:26:42.570
only for video content across
our courses, Andrew and team

468
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.650
are working on a couple of
introductory physics courses.

469
00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.390
Some off you might have seen
this dramatic video lecture,

470
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.330
Walter Lewin's lecture
on OpenCourseWare.

471
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.240
He has been featured
on everything

472
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.080
from Jay Leno to NPR.

473
00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:02.190
But, you know, you can get to
segments of Lewin's lecture,

474
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.390
and they're working on that,
because a current instructor,

475
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.140
Peter Dourmashkin, wants his
students to go to particular

476
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.880
concepts, you know, advanced
learning and particular

477
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.590
things, and the spoken lecture,
you know, at OEIT, we

478
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.970
are stabilizing the research
work in the project and

479
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.730
enabling that kind
of research.

480
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:27.300
Our goal is to take it to open
video content that might be

481
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.140
available across, you know, from
different institutions,

482
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.850
at least as a start for all of
the universities that are in

483
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.230
the OpenCourseWare consortium.

484
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.960
So that's, you can see that
kind of enablement, again,

485
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.100
extending that to, this is a
wonderful project, Shakespeare

486
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.190
in Asia, which has got various
renderings of Shakespeare

487
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.730
presentations, video
presentations, and the idea is

488
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.510
to do the same spoken
lecture browser kind

489
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.560
of access to this.

490
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.360
Those of you who thought
Shakespeare was deal, he is

491
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.830
just living under an assumed
name, and so, but there's --

492
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.990
but this is yet another -- and
I'm showing you these to, let

493
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.110
me give you the sub-text
over here.

494
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:12.700
The idea of these is, see, that
in order to realize the

495
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.320
next stage of educational
transformation through open

496
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.100
resources, we not only need
the surround off active

497
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.060
experience, we also need the
means to go collectively

498
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.550
harvest in useful educational
content very, very easily.

499
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.640
We want to reduce the barriers
to get to them, and I keep

500
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.370
using the word productively,
because you just don't want to

501
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.535
see and not touch, you want to
see, bring, use, and use in

502
00:28:38.535 --> 00:28:40.030
the fashion that you want.

503
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.130
So, how do you productively
combine them?

504
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.110
Now this was a wonderful
project which sort of

505
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.190
demonstrates that, and it was
built on OKI's open service

506
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:51.200
interface definition, the
service interfaces.

507
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.210
And this was, Shigeru Miyagawa,
who is the professor

508
00:28:54.210 --> 00:29:05.220
in Linguistics, actually over
here, and he and John Dower,

509
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.220
who is a prize winning, Pulitzer
winning historian,

510
00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.690
they created this program called
Visualizing Cultures,

511
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.980
by the way, this is an
OpenCourseWare also.

512
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.200
And it goes, the intent was to
teach history and culture,

513
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.070
expose students to Japanese
history and

514
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.830
culture, through images.

515
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.790
Images that are available in a
variety of repositories, some

516
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.790
in Japan, some of the Museum
of Fine Arts over here.

517
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.150
And the idea was to go, be
able to get these through

518
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.190
different kinds of
applications.

519
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.350
And you know, these images
are fantastic.

520
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.720
For instance, some of them,
which have to do with

521
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.820
Commodore Perry's trips to
Japan, and if you look at them

522
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.560
there's a whole city called
Black Ships and Samurai, now

523
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.660
that you see on top.

524
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.600
And it's very interesting,
because depending on the

525
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.080
relationship that the US had
with Japan, people in Japan

526
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.890
would depict Commodore Perry.

527
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.780
So sometimes you see him
characterized as a nice,

528
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.860
beaming, benevolent fellow,
and sometimes you see him

529
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.450
drawn like an ogre.

530
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:10.130
And, you know, it's reflective
of the kinds of, the political

531
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.140
dynamics if you will,
of that period.

532
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.290
But anyway, that's
the content part.

533
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.610
The message here for me, from
this slide, which has to do

534
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.170
with materials from Doc
Edgerton, who was the creator

535
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.250
of strobe photography, who
has, you know, wonderful

536
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.730
archive of materials.

537
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.740
It's to say that we want to be
able to say there are good

538
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.420
qualities of resources, rich
media resources out there, and

539
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.390
we want to be able to really
lower the barrier to getting

540
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.780
to these, and getting to
these through different

541
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.300
applications.

542
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.430
For instance, here you're
seeing, and this is a

543
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.890
three-year old slide, four-year
old slide, here you

544
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.540
are seeing those images that
Shigeru was using for

545
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.710
visualizing cultures, got
through Harvestrodes Hive.

546
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.950
Hive was a Java-based
application.

547
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.440
We had to get to content
from repositories.

548
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.650
You're seeing it accessed
through our course management

549
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.520
system, through a search tool
for the images in our course

550
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.330
management system
on the right.

551
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.330
You're seeing it accessed
through the visual

552
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.120
understanding editor, a
concept tool the Tufts

553
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.890
University created.

554
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.000
So here the idea is that you
can have these, you know,

555
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.860
wonderful depositories of rich
content to do good things

556
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.840
educationally, but you want to
bring them together, make them

557
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:28.060
accessible through OEIT
of open or proprietary

558
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.720
applications.

559
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.930
And that's the kind of
econological transformation

560
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.860
that we think will lead to the,
at least I believe will

561
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.810
lead to this Metaversity
vision.

562
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:43.010
So, and you created, you know,
you, so, the message that we

563
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.810
hear, it's not just about all
the resources that are being

564
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:48.560
created openly, but the
technological enablements, and

565
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.100
then as I will point out in
a bit, the organizational

566
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.000
enablements that will
allow us to approach

567
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.680
that kind of vision.

568
00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.020
So, a lot of the stuff that I
showed you was about deep

569
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.320
learning, subjects and stuff.

570
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.170
The message of open and
transformation is

571
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:07.330
much bigger than that.

572
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.870
This is also, this is not just
about innovation at a

573
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.580
micro-level, and significant
as it is, it's not about

574
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.010
changing courses or even
changing universities, it is

575
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.370
also about national crusades.

576
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:27.120
Scott mention that I had the
opportunity to serve as an

577
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.410
advisor to India's National
Knowledge Commission.

578
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.660
India, as most of you know, is
a country in a hurry, you

579
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:36.240
know, to play in the national,
in the knowledge economy.

580
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.480
And some years ago, you know,
the National Knowledge

581
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.190
Commission was formed by the
Prime Minister to say, how can

582
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:46.430
we really scale excellence,
provide quality it the scales.

583
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.790
To meet the needs off this
explosive economy?

584
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.540
We need knowledge workers
to build roads, to build

585
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.940
hospitals, to build up,
you know, engineering

586
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.040
institutions.

587
00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.970
We need doctors, and how can we
provide quality education

588
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.510
at scale, and knowing what I
know about the numbers, you

589
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.110
cannot do it in the
traditional way.

590
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.520
Not, you can't do it in the
traditional way you can't

591
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.100
build schools I mean I could
give you statistics, 55

592
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.890
million kids who come
out of primary

593
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.830
education, no place to go.

594
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.530
Even if you built a school a
week, it would not be able to

595
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.570
meet the demand.

596
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.910
There are about 11 institutions
in the Institute

597
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.650
of Technology you could keep,
and they are being added on.

598
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:31.860
The message is that what the
open education movement offers

599
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:37.750
is a way of going and being able
to provide that kind of

600
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:41.840
quality education at
scale efficiently.

601
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.770
And, therefore, a whole set of
recommendations were made

602
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.210
which are being acted upon,
which have been accepted.

603
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.580
They are part of the Planning
Commission team entirely based

604
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:57.210
on open education resources,
and again, the model over

605
00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:01.390
here, and this is a real, a very
short-time caricature of

606
00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.180
the recommendations that
I'm presenting to you.

607
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.580
Essentially, to say that, you
know, you can have distributed

608
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.300
depositories of fantastic
content.

609
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.200
You can have a very good
technical substrate, which

610
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.580
allows and good applications,
which allows people to harvest

611
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:21.810
these, and be able to deliver
education to meet the needs of

612
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.100
various sectors.

613
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:29.000
Again, in a scalable and
efficient fashion.

614
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.560
And actually, this particular
slide is because in order to

615
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.540
show that this is not just
a pipe dream, we actually

616
00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.030
started building small
applications to show it.

617
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:44.350
I saw Jeff had just walked in,
Jeff Merrimen, he and I and

618
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.830
some off you might know Stuart
Sim, we actually we're working

619
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.830
with this group called IUCE,
there's an Indo-U.S.

620
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.630
collaboration on engineering
education, and the model was

621
00:34:54.630 --> 00:35:00.610
to see how faculty over here
could, and there, could go get

622
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.580
content from radius open
initiatives from MIT's

623
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.340
OpenCourseWare.

624
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.490
India has put a lot of its
engineering content, there's

625
00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:12.510
an initiative called NPTEL,
The National Program on

626
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:19.450
Technology Enabled Learning,
which has put out about 120 --

627
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.630
I mean it's significant.

628
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.540
All the engineering courses
available through You Tube,

629
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.860
and so what we worked on
was trying to develop a

630
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:32.290
demonstration which would allow
faculty to get content

631
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:36.510
from OCW, from NPTEL from Rice
University's connections, and

632
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.290
create courses along with the
collaborative surround, you

633
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.270
know we keep it surround,
so that they actually

634
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.100
collaborate, construct
the courses

635
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.050
from various resources.

636
00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:53.900
So that's the value
proposition.

637
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.540
If you look at what I have, when
I talk about Metaversity

638
00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:02.110
two, the elements of the open
movement that it really draws

639
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:09.760
upon is aid that you can have
large, sort of unprecedented

640
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.740
volume of quality resources,
which are available anywhere,

641
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.190
anytime, you know, through
the kinds of

642
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.500
enablements I described.

643
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.050
What's more, because of the
way they are constructed,

644
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.485
because, and the kinds of
information that surrounds

645
00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:29.260
them, they can actually
be localized.

646
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:33.570
And you know, I personally am a
very big believer, you know,

647
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.840
we keep talking about education
being a cottage

648
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.800
industry, as if it was
something bad.

649
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.510
I actually believe that it
derives its value from being a

650
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.760
cottage industry, and part of
the challenge that we face is

651
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.340
how can we really make that
cottage industry thrive

652
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.810
efficiency?

653
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.500
And when I say cottage industry,
it means that a lot

654
00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:01.020
of value is derived locally, and
we need to -- the idea of,

655
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.980
one of the things that the
open education resource

656
00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.200
movement offers is that you can
have large pools of shared

657
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.870
resources, without militating
against the localization that

658
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.380
is very important for good
education to happen.

659
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.770
It provides alternatives, you
know, deeper learning, and I

660
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.800
will some examples.

661
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.270
One of the things that it does
allow, and this is not in my

662
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.800
slides, but I will make
a quick mention.

663
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.510
It does allow a lot
of feedback.

664
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.640
When we talk about educational
transformation, it's not just

665
00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.100
about access and good tools,
but what is the generated

666
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.440
mechanism that you
have in order to

667
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.330
improve on what you do?

668
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:46.030
Now, I remember when
OpenCourseWare was launched,

669
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.740
Shigeru, whom I refer to, now
it's visualizing cultures, he

670
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.000
had a wonderful statement out
there on our website, the OCW

671
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.960
websites, which said that, you
know, this is about we, as

672
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.640
educators, we know how to share
our research, but we

673
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.820
don't know how to share our
pedagogy for critical review.

674
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.170
Now, if you think about it for
a second, what you really do

675
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.290
through OpenCourseWare
is you say, look,

676
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.650
this is how we teach.

677
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.830
Have at it.

678
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.430
Tell us what you can do.

679
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:19.450
So that's, and if you can have
the means to incorporate that

680
00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:23.310
feedback that people might give
you into continuously

681
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.140
improving your courses, good
things can happen.

682
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.550
And there's a very good
demonstration of this.

683
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.230
Carnegie Mellon has set up this
thing called, they have

684
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:35.610
this initiative called the Open
Learning Initiative, OLI,

685
00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:39.440
and there's a statistics
course where they have

686
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.110
created, which allows the
community to give feedback,

687
00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:45.520
and then that's incorporated
into the into the course

688
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.900
segments themselves, and what
they've found was that they

689
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.140
had a learning gain of 50% in
the delivery of the statistics

690
00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.790
course, and I'll tell
you what that means.

691
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:58.480
What it means is that coverage,
which they would

692
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.290
have had, and without
sacrificing quality, the time

693
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.510
to deliver that course was, for
the same learning games,

694
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.790
was decreased by 50%.

695
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:10.270
Now that is significant.

696
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.860
That is transubmitive, and we
are not, and this is well

697
00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.410
written about.

698
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:15.870
In fact, Candice [? Till ?]

699
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.120
still has written about this
in the book, that we,

700
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.430
according to, that Scott
was referring to.

701
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.385
So there's this dimension of
collected improvement and

702
00:39:24.385 --> 00:39:27.990
feedback, both at the micro
level and at the macro level

703
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.350
that is really, really important
when you think about

704
00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:34.840
transformation that's afforded
by open education.

705
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.920
So all that's fine.

706
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.140
When I think about possibility
as a signal, there are two

707
00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.790
dimensions that are really
important that we all talk

708
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.120
about, which are enabled
by this.

709
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.890
One which I loosely call
blended learning

710
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.160
opportunities.

711
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.240
And what openness allows is
really, and this again speaks

712
00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.800
to the context of setting
statements that Scott was

713
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.120
making allows us to really
look at possibilities for

714
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.320
intelligently combining the
physical and the virtual.

715
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.200
How we might, you know, the
highlight example for this,

716
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:13.580
how might we combine what we
know as good practices and

717
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.130
situated learning, the kinds
of authentic learning

718
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.220
experiences that we provide
in this situation.

719
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.370
The labs, with what
might be digitally

720
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.000
available, online available.

721
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.090
So it purely provides
opportunities to mix and melt

722
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:32.210
the best of good worlds, and
to be able to localize it.

723
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.990
And this is being done.

724
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:41.150
This is not something that came
out of some lazy exercise

725
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:45.470
in -- what shall I say, on
controlled substances.

726
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.810
This is the kind of stuff that
has been practiced, developed,

727
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:53.130
and demonstrated you know,
through things like iLabs that

728
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.180
I'm talking about, and we have
to start looking at these for

729
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.340
transformation.

730
00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.230
You know, the combining the
formal and the non-formal

731
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.080
here, for instance, we are
thinking, how can we use

732
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.030
co-curricular experiences and
combine them with, you know,

733
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.460
as good substitutes for
authentic learning

734
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.480
experiences.

735
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.740
These are the enablements of
open, given the very generous

736
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.940
definition of open that I
provided here, you know, about

737
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.170
open technology, open content,
and open knowledge.

738
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:30.100
The other really value element,
value vision element

739
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.730
for me is boundary-less
education.

740
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.980
And again, this is not about
traditional boundaries,

741
00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.140
geopolitical boundaries, some of
which is true, like in the

742
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.860
IUCEE example I gave, but
even boundaries between

743
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.750
disciplines.

744
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.660
If you go to the OpenCourseWare
site, you will

745
00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:51.450
see some new programs that have
been launched for energy

746
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.450
studies, right?

747
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.530
And these are being possible,
made possible, some of these

748
00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.410
boundaries are diminishing our
ability to leverage, content

749
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.910
is happening, because the
substance of the component

750
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.570
courses are becoming visible,
and people are being able to

751
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.570
see much more finely where there
might be substitutions,

752
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.020
where there might be
opportunities to have

753
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:17.080
compounds of these courses to
lead to new programs that

754
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.600
transcend disciplinary
boundaries or department

755
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.220
boundaries.

756
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.110
I could give you other examples
with there is

757
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.380
boundary-less-ness being
experienced where the boundary

758
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.370
between research learnings and
the lay person is being

759
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.480
diminished.

760
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.000
Neeru Paharia, she's is of the
Graduate Business School over

761
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.590
here at Harvard.

762
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:42.940
She used to be Director of
Creative Commons, so she has

763
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.240
worked on something called
Acawiki, A C A W I K I, where

764
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.870
actually people go in and
provide sense-making documents

765
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.710
for the lay people, you and I,
who fund research, to have, to

766
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.770
understand research, again, to
take away the divide between,

767
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:03.610
to diminish the divide between
research and lay people.

768
00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.990
So there's a lot of
boundary-less-ness that can

769
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:11.860
being enabled through
openness.

770
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:16.500
So I'm going to start, this is
my, sort of getting to my

771
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.980
closing statements over here.

772
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.290
We have this movement, and you
say, well, you know, here's

773
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.730
this guy, he's talking about
all these wonderful

774
00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:27.240
possibilities, and like I said,
you know, this is not a

775
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.210
pipe dream.

776
00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:35.060
How do we interpret pipe, b but
it's born out of really

777
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.680
looking at some markers, some of
the significant influences

778
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.360
that are around us, that
give me comfort,

779
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.690
give me solid hope.

780
00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:48.030
You know, and some of it is
because many of us in this

781
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:52.210
room are invested and engaged
in these initiatives.

782
00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.950
So one significant category of
significant influence I've

783
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.750
already talked a lot about, is
the fact that there's a lot of

784
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.800
open content, there is
good open technology

785
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.390
initiatives going on.

786
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:08.470
Good design, and I mean this
both in terms of organization

787
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.190
and technology.

788
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.700
I particularly like to talk
about my pet initiative, the

789
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.930
open knowledge initiative, which
allows this kind of, you

790
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.730
know, Scott referred to it as
disaggregation, which allows

791
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.835
different players, different
qualities, different

792
00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:24.900
strengths to play.

793
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.260
So, there are design enablers,
and design is a very important

794
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.030
consideration.

795
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.340
But there are legal enablers,
creative commons, for

796
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:39.510
instance, which, you know, so
which give me hope that this

797
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.420
vision of Metaversity
II is, indeed,

798
00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.490
realizable and can be reaffied.

799
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:49.550
But there are two dimensions
which I have not touch upon

800
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.480
which I'll quickly tell you.

801
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.740
One is institutional
commitment.

802
00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:57.670
And some of the institutional
commitment is expressed

803
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.970
through communities that
are being created.

804
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.820
The Sakai community, consortia
around iLabs

805
00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.050
that are being built.

806
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.960
The groups that meet
around OKI.

807
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.580
So these are expressions of
institutional commitment

808
00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.970
around things open that are
forming, which so which are

809
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.560
really becoming the building
blocks for this

810
00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.000
open education movement.

811
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.580
There is another kind, which I
really pointed to, and I had a

812
00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.270
bunch of slides, and I think
they got finished by today's

813
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:29.220
web page from MIT that I showed
you, which is a real

814
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.050
expression of MIT commitment.

815
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:35.440
The slides I was going to show
you, which are really, have to

816
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.140
do with the fact that MIT
expressed its initial, its

817
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.510
institutional commitment to
OpenCourseWare through a lot a

818
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:46.290
strategic thinking that
preceded the launch of

819
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.850
OpenCourseWare, it's current
commitment to it, right?

820
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:55.410
And to openness, as expressed
wonderfully by, you know, by

821
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.930
today's web page.

822
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.400
And there is a second dimension
off this, there is

823
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.700
another aspect which is on the
collectivity culture, and you

824
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.320
see that, you know, through
the Wikis, the blogs, the

825
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.590
distributed culture, all the
tools and artifacts of the

826
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.610
digital natives that Scott
was talking about.

827
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.010
So very quickly, some things
about MIT's institutional

828
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.470
commitments.

829
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.550
Like I said, OpenCourseWare
was preceded by a lot of

830
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:21.880
strategic thinking.

831
00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.890
You know, we had this Counsel
on Education Technology, and

832
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.580
there was a particular strategic
thrust around

833
00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.810
bolstering the commons off
the mind, you know.

834
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:35.240
Nice words chosen by Hal
Abelson, who was, you know,

835
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.660
who was a leader in education
technology over here at MIT.

836
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.070
And we had a lot of strategies
around active learning, which

837
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.970
led to all kinds of initiatives
like, you know,

838
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.350
TEAL and iLab and so on.

839
00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:54.580
But the strategy around
intellectual commons was what

840
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.920
was an expression of MIT's
institutional commitment to

841
00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.740
things open.

842
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.480
In fact, at that time, and these
slides are dated, you

843
00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:10.170
know, they're circa 2004, but
these initiatives that were

844
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.010
launched were part of an
institutional strategy and the

845
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.560
present MIT's commitment.

846
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:22.720
This base, which is a very, very
big base, to the website

847
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.310
announcement that you saw about
open access to research,

848
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.170
OKI that you've heard about,
OpenCourseWare that I need not

849
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:30.020
speak about.

850
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.260
So, the institutional commitment
was because it was

851
00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.890
seen as important elements of
educational strategy at MIT.

852
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:44.480
Now, the second thing about the
collectivity culture, and

853
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.250
I'm going to close over here,
the collectivity culture is

854
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:54.500
really expressed through, you
know, through what we see.

855
00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.990
And my boss, Dan Hastings,
who's the Dean of

856
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.670
Undergraduate Education over
here, has sent us these slides

857
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:02.790
sometime ago.

858
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.070
And for me, they tells the
story about the digital

859
00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:10.820
natives, and the collectivity
culture, which I think gives

860
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.830
me comfort that -- well, on the
one hand it makes it very

861
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:19.380
important that we continue to
march on, on this road towards

862
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.920
Metaversity two, but at the same
time it gives me comfort

863
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.290
that it's well on it's way
to being reaffied.

864
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.500
So here are a set of slides
that Dan gave that I think

865
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.710
speak to the collectivity
culture.

866
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.030
This is by a group of students
who fancy that they work at

867
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.470
NASA, and who also asking why
aren't we working at NASA.

868
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:41.650
And they are --

869
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.740
I won't say much why
it is being played,

870
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.290
they are from gen-Y.

871
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.480
Gen-Y is, by the way, it is
characterized by everyone

872
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:54.740
between 14 and they say 40,
but I'm going to say 50s.

873
00:48:54.740 --> 00:49:00.730
So and well, these are the,
and you're seeing

874
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.440
characteristics of
this collectivity

875
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:09.070
generations, right?

876
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:43.820
So they're talking about why are
-- it's self-explanatory.

877
00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:49.380
Now, there are tools that they,
and this speaks exactly

878
00:49:49.380 --> 00:50:07.400
to your point, By the way,
this is just a sort of

879
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.950
disclaimer slide to say that
NASA actually uses a lot of

880
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:10.620
these tools.

881
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.900
I think I have said enough.

882
00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.600
I hope I have given
you a message.

883
00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.690
Thank you very much, and
I hope the message off

884
00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.020
everything open is clear.

885
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.260
And I don't know, Scott, if
you wanted to take any

886
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:25.750
questions, or if -- what have
you noticed, but thanks a lot.

887
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:36.913
