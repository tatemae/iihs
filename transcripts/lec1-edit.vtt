1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm Walter Lewin.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I will be your lecturer
this term.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In physics, we explore the
very small to the very large.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The very small is a small
fraction of a proton

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the very large is
the universe itself.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They span 45 orders
of magnitude--

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a 1 with 45 zeroes.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
To express measurements
quantitatively

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we have to introduce units.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And we introduce for the unit
of length, the meter;

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
for the unit of time,
the second;

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and for the unit of mass,
the kilogram.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now, you can read in your book
how these are defined

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and how the definition
evolved historically.

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, there are
many derived units

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which we use in our daily life
for convenience

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and some are tailored
toward specific fields.

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We have centimeters,
we have millimeters

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
kilometers.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We have inches, feet, miles.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Astronomers even use
the astronomical unit

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is the mean distance
between the Earth and the sun

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and they use light-years

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which is the distance that
light travels in one year.

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We have milliseconds,
we have microseconds

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we have days, weeks, hours,
centuries, months--

27
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
all derived units.

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For the mass, we have
milligrams, we have pounds

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we have metric tons.

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So lots of derived units exist.

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Not all of them are
very easy to work with.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I find it extremely difficult
to work with inches and feet.

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's an extremely
uncivilized system.

34
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I don't mean to insult you,
but think about it--

35
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
12 inches in a foot,
three feet in a yard.

36
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Could drive you nuts.

37
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I work almost
exclusively decimal,

38
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and I hope you will do the same
during this course

39
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but we may make some exceptions.

40
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I will now first show you
a movie,

41
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which is called
The Powers of Ten.

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It covers 40 orders
of magnitude.

43
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It was originally conceived
by a Dutchman named Kees Boeke

44
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in the early '50s.

45
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is the second-generation
movie, and you will hear

46
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the voice of Professor Morrison,
who is a professor at MIT.

47
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The Power of Ten--
40 Orders of Magnitude.

48
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Here we go.

49
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I already introduced,
as you see there

50
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
length, time and mass

51
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and we call these

52
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the three fundamental quantities
in physics.

53
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I will give this the symbol
capital L for length

54
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
capital T for time,
and capital M for mass.

55
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
All other quantities in physics
can be derived

56
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
from these fundamental
quantities.

57
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'll give you an example.

58
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I put a bracket around here.

59
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I say speed, and that means
the dimensions of speed.

60
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The dimensions of speed is
the dimension of length

61
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
divided by the dimension
of time.

62
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So I can write for that:
[L] divided by [T].

63
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Whether it's meters per second
or inches per year

64
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that's not what matters.

65
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It has the dimension
length per time.

66
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Volume would have
the dimension

67
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
of length to the power three.

68
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Density would have
the dimension

69
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of mass per unit volume

70
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so that means
length to the power three.

71
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
All-important in our course
is acceleration.

72
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We will deal a lot
with acceleration.

73
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Acceleration, as you will see,
is length per time squared.

74
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The unit is meters
per second squared.

75
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So you get length
divided by time squared.

76
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So all other quantities
can be derived

77
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
from these three fundamental.

78
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So now that we have agreed
on the units--

79
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we have the meter,
the second and the kilogram--

80
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we can start making
measurements.

81
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now, all-important
in making measurements

82
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
which is always ignored
in every college book

83
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is the uncertainty
in your measurement.

84
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Any measurement that you make

85
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
without any knowledge
of the uncertainty

86
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is meaningless.

87
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I will repeat this.

88
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I want you to hear it tonight
at 3:00 when you wake up.

89
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Any measurement that you make

90
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
without the knowledge
of its uncertainty

91
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is completely meaningless.

92
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
My grandmother used
to tell me that...

93
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
at least she believed it...

94
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that someone who is lying in bed

95
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
is longer than
someone who stands up.

96
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And in honor of my grandmother

97
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I'm going to bring
this today to a test.

98
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I have here a setup where I can
measure a person standing up

99
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and a person lying down.

100
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It's not the greatest bed,
but lying down.

101
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I have to convince you

102
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
about the uncertainty
in my measurement

103
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
because a measurement without
knowledge of the uncertainty

104
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
is meaningless.

105
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And therefore, what I will do
is the following.

106
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I have here an aluminum bar

107
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and I make the reasonable,
plausible assumption

108
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that when this aluminum bar
is sleeping--

109
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
when it is horizontal--

110
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that it is not longer than
when it is standing up.

111
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
If you accept that,
we can compare

112
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the length of this aluminum bar
with this setup

113
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and with this setup.

114
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
At least we have some kind
of calibration to start with.

115
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I will measure it.

116
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You have to trust me.

117
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
During these three months,
we have to trust each other.

118
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So I measure here,
149.9 centimeters.

119
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
However, I would think
that the...

120
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
so this is the aluminum bar.

121
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
This is in vertical position.

122
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
149.9.

123
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
But I would think that the
uncertainty of my measurement

124
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is probably 1 millimeter.

125
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I can't really guarantee you

126
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that I did it accurately
any better.

127
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So that's the vertical one.

128
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Now we're going to measure
the bar horizontally

129
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
for which we have a setup here.

130
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Oops!

131
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The scale is on your side.

132
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So now I measure
the length of this bar.

133
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
150.0 horizontally.

134
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
150.0, again, plus or minus
0.1 centimeter.

135
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So you would agree with me
that I am capable of measuring

136
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
plus or minus 1 millimeter.

137
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
That's the uncertainty
of my measurement.

138
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Now, if the difference
in lengths

139
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
between lying down
and standing up

140
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
if that were one foot

141
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
we would all know it,
wouldn't we?

142
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
You get out of bed
in the morning

143
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
you lie down and you get up
and you go, clunk!

144
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And you're one foot shorter.

145
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And we know that that's
not the case.

146
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
If the difference were
only one millimeter

147
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
we would never know.

148
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Therefore, I suspect that
if my grandmother was right

149
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
then it's probably only
a few centimeters,

150
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
maybe an inch.

151
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And so I would argue that
if I can measure

152
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the length of a student
to one millimeter accuracy

153
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that should settle the issue.

154
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So I need a volunteer.

155
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You want to volunteer?

156
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
You look like you're very tall.

157
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I hope that... yeah, I hope that
we don't run out of, uh...

158
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You're not taller
than 178 or so?

159
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
What is your name?

160
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
STUDENT:
Rick Ryder.

161
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
LEWIN:
Rick-- Rick Ryder.

162
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
You're not nervous, right?

163
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
RICK:
No!

164
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
LEWIN:
Man!

165
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
(class laughs )

166
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Sit down.

167
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
(class laughs )

168
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I can't have tall guys here.

169
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Come on.

170
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We need someone
more modest in size.

171
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Don't take it personal, Rick.

172
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay, what is your name?

173
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
STUDENT:
Zach.

174
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
LEWIN:
Zach.

175
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Nice day today, Zach, yeah?

176
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You feel all right?

177
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Your first lecture at MIT?

178
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I don't.

179
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Okay, man.

180
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Stand there, yeah.

181
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Okay, 183.2.

182
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Stay there, stay there.

183
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Don't move.

184
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Zach...

185
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
This is vertical.

186
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
What did I say?

187
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
180?

188
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Only one person.

189
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
183?

190
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Come on.

191
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
.2--

192
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Okay, 183.2.

193
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yeah.

194
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And an uncertainty
of about one...

195
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Oh, this is centimeters--
0.1 centimeters.

196
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And now we're going to measure
him horizontally.

197
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Zach, I don't want you
to break your bones

198
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
so we have a little step
for you here.

199
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Put your feet there.

200
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Oh, let me remove
the aluminum bar.

201
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Watch out for the scale.

202
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
That you don't break that,
because then it's all over.

203
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Okay, I'll come on your side.

204
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I have to do that-- yeah, yeah.

205
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Relax.

206
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Think of this
as a small sacrifice

207
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
for the sake of science, right?

208
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Okay, you good?

209
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
ZACH:
Yeah.

210
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
LEWIN:
You comfortable?

211
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
(students laugh )

212
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You're really comfortable,
right?

213
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
ZACH:
Wonderful.

214
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
LEWIN:
Okay.

215
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You ready?

216
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
ZACH:
Yes.

217
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
LEWIN:
Okay.

218
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Okay.

219
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
185.7.

220
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Stay where you are.

221
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
185.7.

222
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I'm sure... I want to first
make the subtraction, right?

223
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
185.7, plus or minus
0.1 centimeter.

224
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Oh, that is five...

225
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that is 2.5 plus or minus
0.2 centimeters.

226
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You're about one inch taller
when you sleep

227
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
than when you stand up.

228
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
My grandmother was right.

229
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
She's always right.

230
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Can you get off here?

231
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I want you to appreciate
that the accuracy...

232
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Thank you very much, Zach.

233
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
That the accuracy
of one millimeter

234
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
was more than sufficient
to make the case.

235
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
If the accuracy
of my measurements

236
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
would have been much less

237
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
this measurement would not
have been convincing at all.

238
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So whenever you make
a measurement

239
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
you must know the uncertainty.

240
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Otherwise, it is meaningless.

241
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Galileo Galilei asked himself
the question:

242
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Why are mammals as large as
they are and not much larger?

243
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
He had a very clever reasoning
which I've never seen in print.

244
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But it comes down to the fact
that he argued

245
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that if the mammal
becomes too massive

246
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that the bones will break

247
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and he thought that that
was a limiting factor.

248
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Even though I've never
seen his reasoning in print

249
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I will try to reconstruct it

250
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
what could have gone
through his head.

251
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Here is a mammal.

252
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And this is one of the
four legs of the mammal.

253
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And this mammal has a size S.

254
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And what I mean by that is

255
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
a mouse is yay big
and a cat is yay big.

256
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
That's what I mean by size--
very crudely defined.

257
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The mass of the mammal is M

258
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and this mammal has
a thigh bone

259
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
which we call the femur,
which is here.

260
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And the femur of course carries
the body, to a large extent.

261
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And let's assume that the femur
has a length l

262
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and has a thickness d.

263
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Here is a femur.

264
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
This is what a femur
approximately looks like.

265
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So this will be the length
of the femur...

266
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and this will be
the thickness, d

267
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and this will be
the cross-sectional area A.

268
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000

269
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I'm now going to take you
through what we call in physics

270
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
a scaling argument.

271
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I would argue that the length
of the femur

272
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
must be proportional
to the size of the animal.

273
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
That's completely plausible.

274
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
If an animal is four times
larger than another

275
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
you would need four times
longer legs.

276
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And that's all this is saying.

277
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's very reasonable.

278
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It is also very reasonable
that the mass of an animal

279
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is proportional
to the third power of the size

280
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
because that's related
to its volume.

281
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And so if it's related
to the third power of the size

282
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
it must also be proportional

283
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to the third power of the length
of the femur

284
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
because of this relationship.

285
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Okay, that's one.

286
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Now comes the argument.

287
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Pressure on the femur
is proportional

288
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to the weight of the animal
divided by the cross-section A

289
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
of the femur.

290
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
That's what pressure is.

291
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And that is the mass
of the animal

292
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
that's proportional

293
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to the mass of the animal
divided by d squared

294
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
because we want the area here,
it's proportional to d squared.

295
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Now follow me closely.

296
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If the pressure is higher
than a certain level

297
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
the bones will break.

298
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Therefore, for an animal
not to break its bones

299
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
when the mass goes up
by a certain factor

300
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
let's say a factor of four

301
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
in order for the bones
not to break

302
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
d squared must also go up
by a factor of four.

303
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
That's a key argument
in the scaling here.

304
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You really have to think
that through carefully.

305
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Therefore, I would argue

306
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that the mass must be
proportional to d squared.

307
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
This is the breaking argument.

308
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Now compare these two.

309
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
The mass is proportional
to the length of the femur

310
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to the power three

311
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and to the thickness of
the femur to the power two.

312
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Therefore, the thickness of
the femur to the power two

313
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
must be proportional
to the length l

314
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and therefore the thickness of
the femur must be proportional

315
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to l to the power three-halfs.

316
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
A very interesting result.

317
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
What is this result telling you?

318
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
It tells you that if
I have two animals

319
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and one is ten times larger
than the other

320
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
then S is ten times larger

321
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
that the lengths of the legs
are ten times larger

322
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
but that the thickness
of the femur is 30 times larger

323
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
because it is l to the power
three halves.

324
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
If I were to compare
a mouse with an elephant

325
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
an elephant is about a hundred
times larger in size

326
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
so the length of the femur
of the elephant

327
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
would be a hundred times larger
than that of a mouse

328
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
but the thickness of the femur

329
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
would have to be
1,000 times larger.

330
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And that may have convinced
Galileo Galilei

331
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that that's the reason

332
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
why the largest animals are
as large as they are.

333
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Because clearly,
if you increase the mass

334
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
there comes a time that
the thickness of the bones

335
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is the same as the length
of the bones.

336
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
You're all made of bones

337
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and that is biologically
not feasible.

338
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And so there is
a limit somewhere

339
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
set by this scaling law.

340
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Well, I wanted to bring
this to a test.

341
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
After all

342
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I brought my grandmother's
statement to a test

343
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
so why not bring Galileo
Galilei's statement to a test?

344
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And so I went to Harvard

345
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
where they have a beautiful
collection of femurs

346
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and I asked them for the femur
of a raccoon and a horse.

347
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
A raccoon is this big

348
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
a horse is about
four times bigger

349
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
so the length of the femur
of a horse

350
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
must be about four times
the length of the raccoon.

351
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Close.

352
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So I was not surprised.

353
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Then I measured the thickness,
and I said to myself, "Aha!"

354
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
If the length is
four times higher

355
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
then the thickness has
to be eight times higher

356
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
if this holds.

357
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And what I'm going
to plot for you

358
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
you will see that shortly
is d divided by l, versus l

359
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and that, of course,
must be proportional

360
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
to l to the power one-half.

361
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
I bring one l here.

362
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So, if I compare the horse
and I compare the raccoon

363
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I would argue that the thickness

364
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
divided by the length
of the femur for the horse

365
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
must be the square root of four,
twice as much

366
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
as that of the raccoon.

367
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And so I was very anxious
to plot that, and I did that

368
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and I'll show you the result.

369
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Here is my first result.

370
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
So we see there, d over l.

371
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I explained to you why
I prefer that.

372
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And here you see the length.

373
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
You see here the raccoon
and you see the horse.

374
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And if you look carefully,
then the d over l for the horse

375
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
is only about one and a half
times larger than the raccoon.

376
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Well, I wasn't too disappointed.

377
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
One and a half is not two, but
it is in the right direction.

378
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
The horse clearly has a larger
value for d over l

379
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
than the raccoon.

380
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I realized I needed more data,
so I went back to Harvard.

381
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I said, "Look, I need a smaller
animal, an opossum maybe

382
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
maybe a rat, maybe a mouse,"
and they said, "okay."

383
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
They gave me three more bones.

384
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
They gave me an antelope

385
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
which is actually a little
larger than a raccoon

386
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and they gave me an opossum
and they gave me a mouse.

387
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Here is the bone
of the antelope.

388
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Here is the one of the raccoon.

389
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Here is the one of the opossum.

390
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And now you won't believe this.

391
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
This is so wonderful,
so romantic.

392
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
There is the mouse.

393
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
(students laugh )

394
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Isn't that beautiful?

395
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Teeny, weeny little mouse?

396
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
That's only a teeny,
weeny little femur.

397
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And there it is.

398
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And I made the plot.

399
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I was very curious
what that plot would look like.

400
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
And...

401
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
here it is.

402
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Whew! I was shocked.

403
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I was really shocked.

404
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Because look-- the horse
is 50 times larger in size

405
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
than the mouse.

406
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
The difference in d over l
is only a factor of two.

407
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And I expected something more
like a factor of seven.

408
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And so, in d over l, where
I expect a factor of seven

409
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I only see a factor of two.

410
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
So I said to myself,
"Oh, my goodness.

411
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Why didn't I ask them
for an elephant?"

412
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
The real clincher
would be the elephant

413
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
because if that goes
way off scale

414
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
maybe we can still rescue the
statement by Galileo Galilei

415
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
and so I went back
and they said

416
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
"Okay, we'll give you
the femur of an elephant."

417
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
They also gave me one
of a moose, believe it or not.

418
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I think they wanted to get
rid of me by that time

419
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
to be frank with you.

420
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And here is the femur
of an elephant.

421
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And I measured it.

422
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
The length and the thickness.

423
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And it is very heavy.

424
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
It weighs a ton.

425
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I plotted it, I was
full of expectation.

426
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
I couldn't sleep all night.

427
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
And there's the elephant.

428
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
There is no evidence whatsoever
that d over l is really larger

429
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
for the elephant
than for the mouse.

430
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
These vertical bars indicate
my uncertainty

431
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
in measurements of thickness

432
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
and the horizontal scale,
which is a logarithmic scale...

433
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
the uncertainty
of the length measurements

434
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
is in the thickness
of the red pen

435
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
so there's no need for me
to indicate that any further.

436
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And here you have
your measurements

437
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
in case you want to check them.

438
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And look again at the mouse
and look at the elephant.

439
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
The mouse has indeed only one
centimeter length of the femur

440
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
and the elephant is, indeed,
hundred times longer.

441
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
So the first scaling argument
that S is proportional to l

442
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
that is certainly
what you would expect

443
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
because an elephant is about
a hundred times larger in size.

444
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
But when you go to d over l,
you see it's all over.

445
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
The d over l for the mouse

446
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
is really not all that
different from the elephant

447
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
and you would have expected
that number to be

448
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
with the square root of

449
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
so you expect it to be
ten times larger

450
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
instead of about the same.

451
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I now want to discuss with you

452
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
what we call in physics
dimensional analysis.

453
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
I want to ask myself
the question:

454
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
If I drop an apple
from a certain height

455
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and I change that height

456
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
what will happen with the time
for the apple to fall?

457
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Well, I drop the apple
from a height h

458
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000
and I want to know what happened
with the time when it falls.

459
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And I change h.

460
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
So I said to myself,
"Well, the time that it takes

461
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
must be proportional to the
height to some power alpha."

462
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Completely reasonable.

463
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
If I make the height larger

464
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
we all know that it takes longer
for the apple to fall.

465
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
That's a safe thing.

466
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
I said to myself, "Well,
if the apple has a mass m

467
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
"it probably is
also proportional

468
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
to the mass of that apple
to the power beta."

469
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
I said to myself, "Gee, yeah,
if something is more massive

470
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
it will probably
take less time."

471
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
So maybe m to some power beta.

472
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I don't know alpha,
I don't know beta.

473
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
And then I said, "Gee, there's
also something like gravity

474
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that is the Earth's
gravitational pull--

475
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
the gravitational acceleration
of the Earth."

476
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
So let's introduce that, too

477
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and let's assume that that time
is also proportional

478
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
to the gravitational
acceleration--

479
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
this is an acceleration; we will 
learn a lot more about that--

480
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
to the power gamma.

481
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Having said this, we can now do
what's called in physics

482
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
a dimensional analysis.

483
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000

484
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
On the left we have a time

485
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
and if we have a left...
on the left side a time

486
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
on the right side
we must also have time.

487
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
You cannot have coconuts on one
side and oranges on the other.

488
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
You cannot have seconds
on one side

489
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
and meters per second
on the other.

490
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
So the dimensions left and right
have to be the same.

491
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
What is the dimension here?

492
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
That is [T] to the power one.

493
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
That T... that must be the same
as length to the power alpha

494
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
times mass to the power beta,
times acceleration--

495
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
remember, it is still there
on the blackboard--

496
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
that's dimension [L]
divided by time squared

497
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
and the whole thing
to the power gamma

498
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
so I have a gamma here
and I have a gamma there.

499
00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
This side must have the same
dimension as that side.

500
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
That is nonnegotiable
in physics.

501
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Okay, there we go.

502
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
There is no M here,
there is only one M here

503
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
so beta must be zero.

504
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000
There is here [L] to the power
alpha, [L] to the power gamma

505
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
there is no [L] here.

506
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
So [L] must disappear.

507
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
So alpha plus gamma
must be zero.

508
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
There is [T]
to the power one here

509
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
and there is here
[T] to the power -2 gamma.

510
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
It's minus because
it's downstairs.

511
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So one must be equal
to -2 gamma.

512
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
That means gamma must be
minus one half.

513
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
That if gamma is minus one half,
then alpha equals plus one half.

514
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
End of my dimensional analysis.

515
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I therefore conclude that
the time that it takes

516
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
for an object to fall

517
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
equals some constant,
which I do not know

518
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
but that constant
has no dimension--

519
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I don't know what it is--

520
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
times the square root
of h divided by g.

521
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Beta is zero,
there is no mass

522
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
h to the power one half--
you see that here--

523
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
and g to the power
minus one half.

524
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000
This is proportional
to the square root of h

525
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
because g is a given
and c is a given

526
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
even though I don't know c.

527
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I make no pretense that I can
predict how long it will take

528
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
for the apple to fall.

529
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
All I'm saying is, I can compare
two different heights.

530
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I can drop an apple
from eight meters

531
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
and another one from two meters

532
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
and the one from eight meters
will take two times longer

533
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
than the one from two meters.

534
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
The square root of h to two,
four over two

535
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
will take two times longer,
right?

536
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
If I drop one from eight meters

537
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
and I drop another one
from two meters

538
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
then the difference in time will
be the square root of the ratio.

539
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
It will be twice as long.

540
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And that I want to bring
to a test today.

541
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
We have a setup here.

542
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
We have an apple there
at a height of three meters

543
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
and we know the length to an
accuracy... the height

544
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
of about three millimeters,
no better.

545
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And here we have a setup
whereby the apple

546
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
is about one and a half meters
above the ground.

547
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And we know that to about
also an accuracy

548
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000
of no better than
about three millimeters.

549
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
So, let's set it up.

550
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
I have here...

551
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
something that's going
to be a prediction--

552
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
a prediction of the time that
it takes for one apple to fall

553
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
divided by the time
that it takes

554
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
for the other apple to fall.

555
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
H one is three meters

556
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
but I claim there is
an uncertainty

557
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
of about three millimeters.

558
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Can't do any better.

559
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And h 2 equals 1.5 meters

560
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
again with an uncertainty
of about three millimeters.

561
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
So the ratio h one over h two...

562
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
is 2

563
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
and now I have to come up
with an uncertainty

564
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
which physicists sometimes call
an error in their measurements

565
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000
but it's really an uncertainty.

566
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
And the way you find
your uncertainty is

567
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
that you add the three here
and you subtract the three here

568
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
and you get the largest value
possible.

569
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
You can never get
a larger value.

570
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And you'll find
that you get 2.006.

571
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And so I would say
the uncertainty is then .006.

572
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
This is a dimensionless number

573
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
because it's length
divided by length.

574
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And so the time t1
divided by t2

575
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
would be the square root
of h1 divided by h2.

576
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
That is the dimensional
analysis argument

577
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
that we have there.

578
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And we find if we take
the square root of this number

579
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
we find 1.414,
plus or minus 0.0

580
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
and I think that is a two.

581
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
That is correct.

582
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
So here is a firm prediction.

583
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
This is a prediction.

584
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And now we're going to make
an observation.

585
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So we're going to measure t1
and there's going to be a number

586
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and then we're going
to measure t2

587
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
and there's going
to be a number.

588
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I have done this experiment
ten times

589
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
and the numbers always reproduce
within about one millisecond.

590
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
So I could just adopt an
uncertainty of one millisecond.

591
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I want to be a little bit
on the safe side.

592
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Occasionally it differs
by two milliseconds.

593
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
So let us be conservative

594
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
and let's assume that I can
measure this to an accuracy

595
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
of about two milliseconds.

596
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
That is pretty safe.

597
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
So now we can measure
these times

598
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
and then we can take
the ratio

599
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
and then we can see whether
we actually confirm

600
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
that the time that it takes
is proportional to the height

601
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
to the square root
of the height.

602
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
So I will make it a little more
comfortable for you

603
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
in the lecture hall.

604
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
That's all right.

605
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
We have the setup here.

606
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
We first do the experiment
with the... three meters.

607
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
There you see the three meters.

608
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And the time... the moment
that I pull this string

609
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
the apple will fall, the contact
will open, the clock will start.

610
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
The moment that it hits the
floor, the time will stop.

611
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I have to stand on that side.

612
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Otherwise the apple
will fall on my hand.

613
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
That's not the idea.

614
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
I'll stand here.

615
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
You ready?

616
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Okay, then I'm ready.

617
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Everything set?

618
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Make sure that I've
zeroed that properly.

619
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Yes, I have.

620
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Okay.

621
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Three, two, one, zero.

622
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000

623
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
781 milliseconds.

624
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
So this number...
you should write it down

625
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
because you will need it
for your second assignment.

626
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
781 milliseconds, with an
uncertainty of two milliseconds.

627
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
You ready for the second one?

628
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
You ready?

629
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
You ready?

630
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Okay, nothing wrong.

631
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Ready.

632
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Zero, zero, right?

633
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Thank you.

634
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Okay.

635
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Three, two, one, zero.

636
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000

637
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
551 milliseconds.

638
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Boy, I'm nervous because
I hope that physics works.

639
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
So I take my calculator

640
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
and I'm now going to take
the ratio t1 over t2.

641
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
The uncertainty you can find
by adding the two here

642
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
and subtracting the two there

643
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
and that will
then give you an uncertainty

644
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
of, I think, .0... mmm, .08.

645
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Yeah, .08.

646
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
You should do that
for yourself-- .008.

647
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Dimensionless number.

648
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
This would be the uncertainty.

649
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
This is the observation.

650
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
781 divided by 551.

651
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
One point...

652
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Let me do that once more.

653
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Seven eight one,
divided by five five one...

654
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
One four one seven.

655
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Perfect agreement.

656
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Look, the prediction says
1

657
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
but it could be 1 point...
it could be two higher.

658
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
That's the uncertainty
in my height.

659
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
I don't know any better.

660
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And here I could even
be off by an eight

661
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
because that's the uncertainty
in my timing.

662
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
So these two measurements
confirm.

663
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
They are in agreement
with each other.

664
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
You see, uncertainties in
measurements are essential.

665
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Now look at our results.

666
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
We have here a result
which is striking.

667
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
We have demonstrated that
the time that it takes

668
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
for an object to fall
is independent of its mass.

669
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
That is an amazing
accomplishment.

670
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Our great-grandfathers must
have worried about this

671
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
and argued about this
for more than 300 years.

672
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Were they so dumb

673
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
to overlook this simple
dimensional analysis?

674
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Inconceivable.

675
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Is this dimensional analysis
perhaps not quite kosher?

676
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Maybe.

677
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Is this dimensional analysis

678
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
perhaps one that could have
been done differently?

679
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Yeah, oh, yeah.

680
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
You could have done it
very differently.

681
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
You could have said
the following.

682
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
You could have said,
"The time for an apple to fall

683
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
"is proportional to the height
that it falls from

684
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
to a power alpha."

685
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Very reasonable.

686
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
We all know, the higher it is,
the more it will take--

687
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
the more time it will take.

688
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And we could have said,

689
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
"Yeah, it's probably
proportional

690
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
"to the mass somehow.

691
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
If the mass is more, it will
take a little bit less time."

692
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Turns out to be not so,
but you could think that.

693
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
But you could have said

694
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
"Well, let's not take the
acceleration of the Earth

695
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
but let's take the mass
of the Earth itself."

696
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Very reasonable, right?

697
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
I would think if I increased
the mass of the Earth

698
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
that the apple will fall faster.

699
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
So now I will put in the math
of the Earth here.

700
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
And I start
my dimensional analysis

701
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
and I end up dead in the waters.

702
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Because, you see,
there is no mass here.

703
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
There is a mass
to the power beta here

704
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
and one to the power gamma

705
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
so what you would have found
is beta plus gamma equals zero

706
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
and that would be end of story.

707
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Now you can ask yourself
the question

708
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
well, is there something wrong
with the analysis that we did?

709
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Is ours perhaps better
than this one?

710
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Well, it's a different one.

711
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
We came to the conclusion

712
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
that the time that it takes
for the apple to fall

713
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
is independent of the mass.

714
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Do we believe that?

715
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Yes, we do.

716
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
On the other hand, there are
very prestigious physicists

717
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
who even nowadays do
very fancy experiments

718
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
and they try to demonstrate that
the time for an apple to fall

719
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
does depend on its mass

720
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
even though it probably is
only very small, if it's true

721
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
but they try to prove that.

722
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And if any of them succeeds
or any one of you succeeds

723
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000
that's certainly worth
a Nobel Prize.

724
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
So we do believe that it's
independent of the mass.

725
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
However, this, what I did
with you, was not a proof

726
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
because if you do it this way,
you get stuck.

727
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
On the other hand, I'm
quite pleased with the fact

728
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
that we found that the time
is proportional

729
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
with the square root of h.

730
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I think that's very useful.

731
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
We confirmed that
with experiment

732
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
and indeed it came out that way.

733
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
So it was not a complete
waste of time.

734
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
But when you do a dimensional
analysis, you better be careful.

735
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
I'd like you to think this over,
the comparison between the two

736
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
at dinner and maybe at breakfast

737
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
and maybe even while
you are taking a shower

738
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
whether it's needed or not.

739
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
It is important that you
digest and appreciate

740
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
the difference between
these two approaches.

741
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
It will give you an insight
in the power

742
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
and also into the limitations
of dimensional analysis.

743
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
This goes to the very heart

744
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
of our understanding
and appreciation of physics.

745
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
It's important that
you get a feel for this.

746
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
You're now at MIT.

747
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
This is the time.

748
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Thank you.

749
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
See you Friday.

750
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
