<span id='T12'>I think</span>
<span id='T14'>one central </span>
<span id='T15'> challenge of planning</span>
<span id='T16'>is legitimacy of</span>
<span id='T17'>government</span>
<span id='T18'>as a key</span>
<span id='T19'>institution</span>
<span id='T22'>that should be involved</span>
<span id='T23'>in bringing the change</span>
<span id='T25'>The</span>
<span id='T26'>legitimacy of the government</span>
<span id='T27'>is under attack in</span>
<span id='T28'>many different</span>
<span id='T29'>parts of the world</span>
<span id='T32'>so  that it has to be reestablished</span>
<span id='T34'>as a</span>
<span id='T35'>major planning  institution  </span>
<span id='T39'>I think  the second</span>
<span id='T40'>challenge for planning</span>
<span id='T42'>at least </span>
<span id='T43'>in the US  or the</span>
<span id='T44'>west</span>
<span id='T45'>is</span>
<span id='T46'>that the market</span>
<span id='T47'>is steadily</span>
<span id='T48'>declining almost collapsed</span>
<span id='T50'>as </span>
<span id='T51'> you know</span>
<span id='T53'>and the</span>
<span id='T54'>government has</span>
<span id='T55'>to</span>
<span id='T56'>reconstruct that market</span>
<span id='T57'> and I think the third</span>
<span id='T58'>challenge  for</span>
<span id='T59'>planning</span>
<span id='T60'>would  be</span>
<span id='T61'>how to</span>
<span id='T62'>how to</span>
<span id='T63'>involve</span>
<span id='T64'>citizens</span>
<span id='T65'>in the democratic</span>
<span id='T66'>countries</span>
<span id='T69'>in a way</span>
<span id='T70'>in the decision making</span>
<span id='T71'>process</span>
<span id='T73'>which  is</span>
<span id='T75'>manageable which</span>
<span id='T76'>doesn’t make the process</span>
<span id='T77'>of planning too</span>
<span id='T78'>long</span>
<span id='T79'>at the same</span>
<span id='T80'>time involve</span>
<span id='T81'>people I think</span>
<span id='T82'>that that profession</span>
<span id='T83'>of</span>
<span id='T84'>planning</span>
<span id='T85'>has not done</span>
<span id='T86'>that well combining</span>
<span id='T87'>theory with practice</span>
<span id='T88'> and</span>
<span id='T89'>in part because</span>
<span id='T90'>if you look </span>
<span id='T91'> at</span>
<span id='T92'>the history of the profession</span>
<span id='T93'> when</span>
<span id='T94'>it first started  after</span>
<span id='T95'> Second World War</span>
<span id='T96'>in a formal</span>
<span id='T97'>way there was some planning</span>
<span id='T98'>before</span>
<span id='T99'>but after the war</span>
<span id='T101'>the theories</span>
<span id='T102'> looked  very</span>
<span id='T103'>holistic</span>
<span id='T105'>and</span>
<span id='T106'>a very neat</span>
<span id='T109'>whereas the problems </span>
<span id='T110'> were</span>
<span id='T111'>changing because migration was</span>
<span id='T112'>starting  both</span>
<span id='T113'>in let&apos;s  see northern </span>
<span id='T114'>states from the south</span>
<span id='T115'>to the</span>
<span id='T116'>north of African American</span>
<span id='T117'>people and in India from</span>
<span id='T118'> the rural to </span>
<span id='T119'>the poor</span>
<span id='T120'>and</span>
<span id='T121'>somehow the</span>
<span id='T122'>outcomes</span>
<span id='T124'>were never</span>
<span id='T125'>the way we had expected</span>
<span id='T128'> so planning as a</span>
<span id='T129'>field came</span>
<span id='T130'> to be questioned</span>
<span id='T132'>  because it could not explain</span>
<span id='T133'>the</span>
<span id='T138'>outcomes very well cities in the South</span>
<span id='T140'>are going</span>
<span id='T141'>to face even </span>
<span id='T142'>a larger number</span>
<span id='T143'>of people migrating</span>
<span id='T144'>from the rural</span>
<span id='T145'> to</span>
<span id='T146'>the urban areas</span>
<span id='T148'> they have</span>
<span id='T149'>to be</span>
<span id='T150'> given</span>
<span id='T151'>the opportunity</span>
<span id='T152'>to live a decent</span>
<span id='T153'>life</span>
<span id='T154'>they  have to</span>
<span id='T155'>be housed they have</span>
<span id='T156'>to find jobs their children</span>
<span id='T157'>will have to go</span>
<span id='T158'>to school</span>
<span id='T159'>It’s a huge</span>
<span id='T160'>transformation</span>
<span id='T162'>and</span>
<span id='T163'>that</span>
<span id='T164'>transformation has to be managed</span>
<span id='T166'>  in a city</span>
<span id='T168'>A second</span>
<span id='T169'>problem I think</span>
<span id='T170'>connected to that</span>
<span id='T171'>is generally</span>
<span id='T172'>providing education</span>
<span id='T174'>for larger</span>
<span id='T175'>number of people</span>
<span id='T176'>and and  good</span>
<span id='T177'>education</span>
<span id='T178'>so India </span>
<span id='T179'>has tried</span>
<span id='T180'>and</span>
<span id='T181'>have  since</span>
<span id='T182'>our Independence</span>
<span id='T184'>we have  take</span>
<span id='T185'>the decision on that</span>
<span id='T186'>everybody should</span>
<span id='T187'>have advanced education</span>
<span id='T188'>etcetera  </span>
<span id='T189'>but we haven&apos;t  </span>
<span id='T190'>been able to impliment it</span>
<span id='T191'>as</span>
<span id='T192'>effectively </span>
<span id='T193'>so</span>
<span id='T194'>implimenting  </span>
<span id='T195'> things well</span>
<span id='T196'>with the limited</span>
<span id='T197'>resources</span>
<span id='T198'>is</span>
<span id='T199'>a huge</span>
<span id='T200'>challenge of planning</span>
<span id='T202'>A third problem </span>
<span id='T203'>that I think</span>
<span id='T205'>will this</span>
<span id='T206'>country will face</span>
<span id='T207'>is to catch up</span>
<span id='T208'>with</span>
<span id='T209'>other industrialized  </span>
<span id='T210'>countries</span>
<span id='T211'>Industrialisation   </span>
<span id='T212'>is about catching</span>
<span id='T213'>up</span>
<span id='T214'>and</span>
<span id='T215'>some countries have  done</span>
<span id='T216'>better  than other but as</span>
<span id='T217'>the </span>
<span id='T218'> speed</span>
<span id='T219'>of industrialization</span>
<span id='T220'>peaks up</span>
<span id='T222'>it</span>
<span id='T223'>brings  incredible</span>

<span id='T262'>and</span>
<span id='T264'>the people will</span>

<span id='T290'>the lives  </span>
<span id='T291'>of ordinary people</span>
<span id='T295'></span>
<span id='T296'>as a private institution</span>
<span id='T298'>it</span>
<span id='T299'>has a very</span>
<span id='T301'>different demand</span>
<span id='T303'>on it because India </span>
<span id='T304'> in</span>
<span id='T305'>the very</span>
<span id='T306'>beginning education has always been associated</span>
<span id='T307'>with</span>

<span id='T314'>so its now only</span>
<span id='T315'>we have beginning to</span>

<span id='T317'> is</span>
<span id='T318'>not just interested in making</span>

<span id='T320'>interested in doing</span>
<span id='T321'>good things for the country</span>
<span id='T323'>and so</span>
<span id='T324'> in educational</span>
<span id='T325'> terms </span>
<span id='T326'> for first private</span>
<span id='T327'> university   in planning</span>

<span id='T334'>only.</span>
<span id='T337'>I do</span>
<span id='T338'>think </span>
<span id='T339'> one of the biggest</span>
<span id='T340'>challenges you will face</span>
<span id='T341'>is if you really want</span>
<span id='T342'>to produce</span>

<span id='T357'>know I am looking at EPW looking</span>

<span id='T359'>journals   </span>
<span id='T360'>Nagar Lok</span>
<span id='T361'>  </span>
<span id='T363'>I have to say</span>
<span id='T364'>I am some what</span>
<span id='T365'>disappointed  by the</span>
<span id='T366'>by the</span>
<span id='T367'>type of </span>
<span id='T368'>discussion</span>
<span id='T369'> there india </span>
<span id='T370'>has a huge  critical</span>
<span id='T373'>line</span>
<span id='T374'>of thinkers </span>
<span id='T375'>but you need</span>
<span id='T376'>to go beyond criticality</span>
<span id='T377'>to say</span>
<span id='T378'>lets do it this</span>
<span id='T379'>way</span>
<span id='T380'>and that means</span>
<span id='T381'>you have to struggle</span>
<span id='T382'>with things on the</span>
<span id='T383'>ground</span>
<span id='T384'>that we have tried</span>
<span id='T385'>with </span>
<span id='T386'> a lot of sympathy</span>

<span id='T390'> production of that</span>
<span id='T391'>material</span>
<span id='T392'>is</span>
<span id='T393'>a huge </span>
<span id='T394'> task</span>
<span id='T395'>teaching is a very</span>
<span id='T397'>its an art</span>
<span id='T399'>and so you</span>
<span id='T400'>need a group of people</span>
<span id='T401'>who can play</span>
<span id='T402'>that role and who will</span>
<span id='T403'>not just be strict</span>
<span id='T404'>masters You know saying</span>
<span id='T405'>why  haven&apos;t you</span>
<span id='T406'> done that I&apos;m not</span>
<span id='T407'>going to give you a good grade</span>
<span id='T408'>Teaching  is not</span>
<span id='T409'>discipling</span>
<span id='T410'> is</span>
<span id='T411'>to make </span>
<span id='T412'>somebody else say</span>

<span id='T414'>bring</span>
<span id='T415'>it out</span>
<span id='T416'>with assumption</span>
